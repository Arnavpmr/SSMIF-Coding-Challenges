# SSMIF Coding Challenges

The SSMIF Coding Challenges repository is a collection of coding challenges designed for individuals who are applying to the Stevens Student Managed Investment Fund (SSMIF). The challenges cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, from basic syntax and algorithms to more advanced data structures and machine learning techniques.

The repository contains a series of folders, each of which corresponds to a different challenge. Each folder contains a problem statement, a set of input/output examples, and a solution file (in some cases). Members are encouraged to attempt the challenges on their own before reviewing the provided solution file.
